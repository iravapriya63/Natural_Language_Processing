       "'\\n\\nAbuse case  is a specification model for security requirements used in the software development industry. The term Abuse Case is an adaptation of use case. \\nThe term was introduced by John McDermott and Chris Fox in 1999, while working at Computer Science Department of the James Madison University. As defined by its authors, an abuse case is a type of complete interaction between a system and one or more actors, where the results of the interaction are harmful to the system, one of the actors, or one of the stakeholders in the system. We cannot define completeness just in terms of coherent transactions between actors and the system. Instead, we must define abuse in terms of interactions that result in actual harm. A complete abuse case defines an interaction between an actor and the system that  results in harm to a resource associated with one of the actors, one of the stakeholders, or the system itself.\\nTheir notation appears to be similar to Misuse cases, but there are differences reported by Chun Wei in Misuse Cases and Abuse Cases in Eliciting Security Requirements.\\n\\n\\nOverview\\nUse cases specify required behaviour of software and other products under development, and are essentially structured stories or scenarios detailing the normal behavior and usage of the software. Abuse cases extend the UML notation to model abuse in those systems.\\n\\nArea of use\\nAbuse cases are most commonly used in the field of security requirements elicitation.\\n\\nBasic concepts\\nAn abuse case diagram is created together with a corresponding use case diagram, but not in the same diagram (different from Misuse case). There is no new terminology or special symbols introduced for abuse case diagrams. They are drawn with the same symbols as a use case diagram.\\nTo distinguish between the two, the use case diagram and abuse case diagrams are kept separate, and related. Hence abuse cases do not appear in the use case diagrams and vice versa.\\n\\nSee also\\nUse case diagram\\nMisuse case\\nThreat model (software)\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ a b John McDermott and Chris Fox (Dec 1999). \"Using Abuse Case Models for Security Requirements Analysis\" (PDF).

Also, only regard those lemmata that are longer than 1 character and convert them to lowercase. Finally, create a reverse word index using another defaultdict, in which you store for each lemma in which text it occurred. The defaultdict should therefore map from a lemma (the key; you can use the actual string of the lemma) to a list of numbers that represent the respective  texts  (you  can  assign  this  text/document  number  while  looping  through  all  texts) which contain the key. You do not need to count the frequency of lemmata."
